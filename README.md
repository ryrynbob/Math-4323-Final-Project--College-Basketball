## Data Selection
 The source of this dataset is Kaggle. More specifically, the files were procured by Andrew Sunberg, who scraped and cleaned the data from https://www.barttorvik.com/#, a website that collects and tracks statistics about college basketball games. Our inspiration for selecting this dataset is due to the prominence of the University of Houston’s mens’ basketball team at the national level.
      This data set contains 2455 observations of different college basketball teams from 2013 to 2019 with 24 different variables (5 Categorical and 19 Numerical). The variables are as follows: \
**TEAM: The Division I college basketball school (Categorical)\
CONF: The Athletic Conference in which the school participates (Categorical)\
G: Number of games played (Numerical)\
W: Number of games won (Numerical)\
ADJOE: Adjusted Offensive Efficiency (An estimate of the offensive efficiency (points scored per 100 possessions) a team would have against the average Division I defense) (Numerical)\
ADJDE: Adjusted Defensive Efficiency (An estimate of the defensive efficiency (points allowed per 100 possessions) a team would have against the average Division I offense)  (Numerical)\
BARTHAG: Power Rating (Chance of beating an average Division I team) (Numerical)\
EFG_O: Effective Field Goal Percentage Shot (Numerical)\
EFG_D: Effective Field Goal Percentage Allowed (Numerical)\
TOR: Turnover Percentage Allowed (Turnover Rate) (Numerical)\
TORD: Turnover Percentage Committed (Steal Rate) (Numerical)\
ORB: Offensive Rebound Rate (Numerical)\
DRB: Offensive Rebound Rate Allowed (Numerical)\
FTR : Free Throw Rate (How often the given team shoots Free Throws) (Numerical)\
FTRD: Free Throw Rate Allowed (Numerical) \
2P_O: Two-Point Shooting Percentage (Numerical)\
2P_D: Two-Point Shooting Percentage Allowed (Numerical)\
3P_O: Three-Point Shooting Percentage (Numerical)\
3P_D: Three-Point Shooting Percentage Allowed (Numerical)\
ADJ_T: Adjusted Tempo (An estimate of the tempo (possessions per 40 minutes) a team would have against the team that wants to play at an average Division I tempo) (Numerical)\
WAB: Wins Above Bubble (The bubble refers to the cut-off between making the NCAA March Madness Tournament and not making it)  (Numerical)\
POSTSEASON: Round where the given team was eliminated or where their season ended (Categorical)\
SEED: Seed in the NCAA March Madness Tournament (Categorical)**

Damian and Justin will be working on implementing, testing, and optimizing a model using K-Nearest Neighbors. One member will try to determine the optimal value of K. They will also perform cross validation to ensure the model can predict new data.\

Ryan will be performing Principal Component Analysis to potentially reduce the data to several components due to the high dimensionality of the data. \

Hope you enjoy!
